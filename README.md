# Advanced-Data-Analytics
Final project for the Advanced Data Analytics class of Spring 2021 with Professor Simon Scheidegger.

This paper aims to create an event-based trading algorithm, by predicting the direction of an assetâ€™s price movement, using data collected from Reddit as well as historical financial time series. We decided to focus on the S&P500 index, Tesla Corp. and Bitcoin, as the first is the gold-standard equity market index and the last two are greatly discussed on the website.
